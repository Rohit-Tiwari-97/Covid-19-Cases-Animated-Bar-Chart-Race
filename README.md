# Covid-19-Cases-Animated-Bar-Chart-Race
Our task is to create an animated bar chart race(bcr) for the number of countrywise covid-19 cases between the time period of Feb 2020 to April 2021.
Unlike other tutorials that allow you to use a pre loaded bcr dataset, we will process and clean our own dataset. Modify it so that it can be used to create Bar Chart Race.
In this project, I created an animated bar chart race for the number of covid-19 cases of 8 countries India,
USA, China, Brazil, Russia, UK. Bangladesh, Pakistan between the time period of Feb 2020 to April 2021.

Key Skills : Python, pandas library.
